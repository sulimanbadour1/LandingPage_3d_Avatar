## Just an attempt to integrate three js with typescript

<img src ="">
It's just an attempt to make a 3D avatar using React Three Fiber, to
create a 3D avatar, I used a 3D model from ReadyMePlayer and
exported it, then I used the useGLTF hook to load the model and
animations, and finally I used the useAnimations hook to play the
animations.
